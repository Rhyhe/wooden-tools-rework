# Wooden Tool Rework

Currently, this mod adds three options in the config file:

- `unregister`: Unregisters the stone tools recipes. This makes them uncraftable.
- `wood_is_stone`: Replaces the wood material to stone, making wooden tools have the same properties as stone tools.
- `build_better_pickaxe_iron`: Replaces the logo of the achievement BUILD_BETTER_PICKAXE with an iron pickaxe instead of
  a stone pickaxe.

This mod was never tested in multiplayer, so I do not know what would happen.

By default all options will be enabled
